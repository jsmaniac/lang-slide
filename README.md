## Pictures

`main.rkt` provides several picts, with some options. When run on the
command line, it shows a slide that demos the pict.

## Slides

`hudak-quote.rkt` has a slideshow slide that uses the picture along
with a quote from Paul Hudak.

## PNG

`mk-img.rkt` generates a PNG of the image.

## Regenerating the data

`find.rkt` regenerates `lang.plain` and `lang-colors.rktd`
automatically when run.
